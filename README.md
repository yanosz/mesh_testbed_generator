Mesh Testbed Generator
=======================

Buildsystem to generate custom OpenWRT-Firmware files for different nodes in a testbed.

Motivation
-------------
Having set up a mesh of 5 TP Link TL-WR842nd v2 in our hackerspace for testing and research, there's a need for configuration management. Configuration should be:
* Consistent / DRY
* Revertible - especially using `first_boot` 
* Under version control

To archive these goals, a OpenWRT-configuration is generated based on Ruby `.erb` templates. A dedicated firmware file is generated for each node.

Structure
-----------------
* `nodes.yml - inventory of all nodes. A firmware-file is generated per node
* `files` - Directory of .ERB-templates. After processing all ERB-templates, it is integrated into the firmware files
* `bin` - Output folder for firmware files
* `Rakefile` - Central build file

Usage
---------------
1. Adapt `nodes.yml`
2. Adapt templates in `files`
3. Run `rake`

OpenWRT Release (Chaos Calmer) and Platform (TL-WR842nd v2) is hardcoded in `Rakefile`. You have to change it to support other platforms.

Current Configuration
------------------------
Current configuration includes
* Packages like ip, babeld, batman-adv for testing different routing scenarios
* A collectd configuration ping'ing all nodes for measurements
* A wireless configuration putting the wifi into mesh mode while setting TX-power to a minimum
* IPv4 and IPv6 assignments for testing 
* SSH-Key and root-password for accessing the nodes
* Firewall-Rules to allow connections via SSH from WAN
